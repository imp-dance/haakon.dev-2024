CityforCity was started on a voluntary basis at
Idean Bergen. The initiative was a website
where small local businesses that had been
affected by and/or made concrete changes to
their operation because of the covid pandemic
are promoted to their local community.

The original websites for Bergen, Stavanger and
Oslo were all built and hosted at Squarespace,
but this soon showed itself to be very limiting
when the ambitions of the project grew.
Squarespace was generally bad at handling
articles and categorisation and it was
difficult to implement more complex features.
Because of this, we decided to develop our own
custom system.

My role in this project was sketching out and
developing the new system. I decided to go for
GatsbyJS for static rendering, and Strapi as a
CMS system. After setting up the core
functionality, I developed the frontend design
based on an Adobe XD sketch created by a UX
designer at Idean.
