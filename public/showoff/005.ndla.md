This was a short project to create a
network-simulation game to be used in
IT-education on the Norwegian Digital Learning
Arena. The objective of the game is to connect
various nodes through switches to the network,
and to map the correct networks to the correct
devices. The design of the game was made by a
Senior Visual Designer at Idean, and I worked
on implementing the design myself.

The game is made in React.JS with Typescript
and styled-components.

### Some thoughts

The method I used for building this game involved some complex css `calc` based on the dimensions of the building svg. And all the assets are loaded in as normal `img` tags. This worked fine, and within the short time frame I had to build this, it was the only way I could feasibly achieve it. In retrospect, it would probably have been better to build it using `canvas` somehow. I still haven't taken the time to properly learn `canvas`, but I hope to do so soon.
