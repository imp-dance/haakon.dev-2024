I worked for LIGL AS for 4 years, from August
2016 - April 2020.

During my time at LIGL I worked with a great
range of tasks ranging from office IT-support
to web development and legal tech development.

While working at LIGL, I learned how to use
ContractExpress Author to automate legal
documents. I also designed a website that
interacts with these documents, complete with a
login system, rating system, backend
statistics, rating and sorting, and much more.
This website came in many iterations, and is called [Ida by LIGL](https://ida.ligl.no).

I have also developed and designed their
website, [ligl.no](https://ligl.no). This project was started prior to me having
much experience with Javascript frameworks, so
it was made using PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery.
