After 9 months at Idean, because of life
circumstances, I've decided to leave and start
my own company. I'm soon going to move out of
the city, and needed to find a more long-term
remote option, beyond the current pandemic.

Although I initially looked into full-time
remote positions, I did get a proposal to do
contract work for a Norwegian
telecommunications company (Telenor), which I
figured served as a perfect springboard to
start my own company and start working for
myself.

As of now, I'm the only employee at my company ([Ryfylke React](https://ryfylke.dev)).
I'm still in the process of considering what
to do for the future. One option would be
delivering more of a full-stack package and
selling that to local businesses - another
would be continuing to do consultancy work for
larger companies outside of Suldal. The third
option, which is currently where I'm at - would
be essentially both. To achieve this in the
long term, I would most likely need to hire a
team to help me out on local projects.

On that note, if you are interested in joining
my team as a designer or developer (frontend or
backend) - please do reach out through [our website](https://ryfylke.dev)
