I started working as a frontend developer for
Idean in April of 2020. Since then I've been
able to take part in a couple of projects,
namely the CityforCity initiative - as well as
an internal Equinor project.

Working at Idean has been my first official web
developer position, and has allowed me to work
with larger teams of other developers and
designers, which has greatly accelerated my
growth and learning.

We usually have _frontend friday_ every
week, where me and the other frontenders
discuss and share news and interesting things
related to frontend that we've picked up over
the week. We also sometimes do presentations
for eachother on various subjects, to teach and
reflect.

One of my projects at Idean has been developing
the frontend for the City for City initiative.
The websites were developed using Gatsby and
Strapi, and were published October 2020.

I've also been involved in an internal project
at Equinor, which was my first large-scale
Typescript+React project. I worked on
developing and implementing a few new features,
as well as fixing bugs and testing. We used the
agile SCRUM methodology, which I really enjoyed
working with.
