Since February of 2021, I've been working as a
front-end consultant on a project at Telenor, a
Norwegian telecommunications company.

The project I'm working on is related to log
analysis and correlation of messages and log
data from hardware and software.

Although I can't disclose too much about the
project, I can say that it's been an amazing
learning experience. I've been able to work on
complex data visualisation components, and
other interesting things such as working with
websockets, writing functional and unit tests,
setting up a good developer experience, and
much more.

This is my own company's first contract - and I
will most likely be working on this for the
whole of 2021, possibly extending onwards.

Some of my responsibilities and achievements at Telenor include...

- Building complex in-house components for exploring and visualizing data
- Writing unit and integration tests for various features
- Setting up the website for, and writing some of the documentation for the project
- Helping out with onboarding of junior developers
- Lots of input on lead decisions for frontend stack and methodology
- Have been a part of developing and thinking out "across-the-stack" solutions for new features from the ground up
- Have had lots of input on UX and design, as a bridge between the design & development team
- Lots of refactoring, upgrading and migrating to enhance the DX of the codebase, as well as the performance of the product.

I've deepened my knowledge in areas like...

- RTK Query / Tanstack Query data-fetching pattern
- Redux
- Knowing _when_ to reach for useEffect, and when not to
- React rerendering behavior and performance optimization
- Memoizing and caching
- Graph databases
- Functional programming and pure functions
- Testing javascript
- Typescript generics
