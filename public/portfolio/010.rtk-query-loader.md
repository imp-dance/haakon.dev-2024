[rtk-query-loader](https://github.com/ryfylke-react-as/rtk-query-loader#readme) is a package that lets you create reusable and extendable _loaders_ for your React components.

Developing this open source package has taught me a lot about typescript generics, writing good documentation and designing a well thought out developer experience when consuming the package.

At the time of writing, the project has had 200 commits, 10 releases, one major update, 16 github stars and 4 closed issues.

### A brief overview

RTK Query Loader is a package that lets you write reusable and composable _loaders_ for your React components.

> What is a _loader_?

A _loader_ contains queries that should successfully fulfill before render a _consumer_ (typically a component). The loader also contains a loading state and error state to render when appropriate.

Some features include:

- Supply as many queries as you'd like.
- Supply queries that [don't affect loading state](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/features/defer-queries/).
- Send down payloads that contain any static data.
- [Transform](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/transforming) the data to your desired output-format.
- Set up [default](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Quick%20Guide/extend-loader) loading and error states.
- [Extend](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/extending) existing loaders.
- Re-use existing loaders
- Create [stateful loaders](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/stateful-loader)

And even if you don't use `RTK Query`...

- Supply queries that are [just promises](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Exports/use-create-query).
- [Use with other data loading libraries](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/other-libs)
