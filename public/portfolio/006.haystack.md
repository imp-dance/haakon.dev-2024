I was hired as a consultant from Idean to work
on developing the frontend for the proof of
concept for a data-visualisation and anti-fraud
software.

The website was developed using React.JS with
TypeScript and styled-components. For the
graphs, we used Linkurious' Ogma library. For
the charts, we used Nivo.

The proof of concept is running on JSON-data,
but the project structure is set up for a
future handover for further development. Some
of the working features include:

- Geo/map-mode that plots all nodes with coordinates.
- Creating charts based on node-data.
- Expand nodes to show relations.
- Adding pulses to the nodes.
- Shortest-path algorhythm between nodes.
- Adding filters based on node-types, with conditions based on the type properties.
- Hiding individual nodes.
- Graph fullscreen-mode (for map and main graph).

While I'm not a visual-designer, I also made
the logo draft that's featured in the
screenshot above using [logomaker](https://logomaker.thehoth.com/).

I worked on this project for a total of around
4 weeks - building the entire front end in that
time-span. I also helped demo the POC to
multiple clients and partners.
