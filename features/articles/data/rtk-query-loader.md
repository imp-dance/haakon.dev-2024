RTK Query Loader is a NPM package that I have written and maintained for over a year now. I wanted to write an article about the experience, stuff I've learned and where this package is at now.

## Origins

It all started with an abstraction at work which looked something like this:

::: window
app.tsx

```tsx
const App = () => (
    <RTKLoader
        queries=[[query1, query2]]
        onSuccess={(data) => <LoadedComponent data={data} />}
        onLoading={() => <InlineLoading />}
        onError={(error) => <ErrorView error={error} />}
    />
)
```

:::

### Pros & Cons

This was very helpful, some parts of it I loved but other parts of the pattern were very annoying.

- I have to create a wrapper, and an internal `<LoadedComponent>` whenever I use the pattern
- Setting up loading/error views all the time is annoying, and I mostly reuse the loading and error view anyways
- I have to manually type data, and specify that it is `NonNullable`

So I wanted to rethink and redesign this pattern a bit to be more reusable and elegant.

## HOC

> I know, I know, we do not want to go back to the days of wrapping your React components with multiple layers of higher order components - but just take a look at this:

::: window
drafts.tsx

```tsx
const loader = createLoader(...); // somewhere

// Component.tsx
const Component = withLoader((props, data) => {
    return <div>...</div>
}, loader);
```

:::

Higher order components are one of the few use cases that make sense when doing loading on the client side.

> Why?

Because we want to be able to write the component **as if it has loaded already** - I don't want to have lots of checks inside of the body to see if the query data is defined, supply fallbacks, cast types, nested loading spinners, etc... The only way to achieve this is to simply await mounting the component until the data is ensured to have loaded. Higher order components allow for this pattern.

### Creating an initial design

Using the old implementation as a reference, I started working on a design.

The first iteration of the design was flawed, but definitely better than what we started with:

::: window
drafts.tsx

```tsx
// You create a "loader"
const loader = createLoader({
  // it needs: queries, loading state, error state
  // rtk queries are hooks, so it should be a hook.
  queries: () => [useSomeQuery(), useSomeOtherQuery()] as const,
  onLoading: () => <div>Loading...</div>,
  onError: () => <div>Error!</div>,
});

// And then "consume" it
const Component = withLoader((props, data) => {
  const [query1, query2] = data;
  // ...
}, loader);
```

> I found that defining terms, such as a "**_loader_**" or a "**_consumer_**" helps people wrap their head around what is going on and how to use the API.

So this design solved atleast one of my initial issues: I no longer have to create a wrapper component. But it's still not feature complete, and after having used this API for a while I had annoyances with it.

- I can't pass arguments to the loader
- I still have to manually declare loading/error states for every component/loader
- It's not obvious that the `queries` argument is a hook
- It's tedious and easy to forget to use `as const` when returning from `queries`.

### Passing arguments

This was simple enough, I just needed some way to transform the props of the _consumer_ into arguments for the _loader_. So let us add that to `createLoader`:

::: window
examples/args.tsx

```tsx
type ComponentProps = {
  userId: string;
};

const loader = createLoader({
  queriesArg: (props: ComponentProps) => props.userId,
  useQueries: (userId) => [useGetUser(userId)] as const,
});
```

:::

There you go, we now have a way for loaders to utilize their consumers' props inside the loader.

## Extending existing loaders

Now this was a really challenging Typescript task, but after a lot of use of generics and tinkering with the code - I was able to implement the feature.

::: window
examples/extend.tsx

```tsx
const baseLoader = createLoader({
  onLoading: () => <div>...</div>,
  onError: () => <div>...</div>,
});

const userLoader = baseLoader.extend({
  useQueries: () => [useSomeQuery()] as const,
}); // no need to add anything else!
```

:::

This allows for a very nice pattern where you create a base loader with default loading and error states, and extend from that. This will more easily allow you to configure all loaders at once as well - and reuse and extend existing loaders.

In my own experience, I have set up a `baseLoader`, as well as a `baseRouteLoader` and `baseDialogLoader` (both extended from `baseLoader`). You can set it up however you want.

### Rethinking some of the API

At this point, I was about 4 months and 4 versions into writing the package. I felt it was time for a major update. This also meant that I could take a look back at the interface and fix things that were bothering me. Notably, having to specify `as const` after the `useQueries` argument.

I solved this by returning an object instead of an array. I also implemented `deferredQueries` as an optional way of returning queries from the loader - hinting that the queries should not block the consumer from loading.

::: window
examples/v1.tsx

```tsx
const loader = baseLoader.extend({
  useQueries: () => ({
    queries: {
      user: useGetUserQuery(),
    },
    deferredQueries: {
      extraData: useGetGiantDataset(),
    },
    payload: {
      any: {
        arbitrary: "data",
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

:::

Now this is starting to look more feature complete. Adding `payload` as a way to pass _anything_ from the loader to the consumer opens up the possibility for stateful and controlled loaders as well. ðŸ”¥

### Maintaining the package

When dealing with component loading, it is kind of critical that you don't push bugs. For this reason, I ended up writing a test suite of about 30 tests that verify that everything is working correctly in the package.

I also wrote [extensive documentation](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/) for the package by using Docusaurus.

### Final thoughts

Writing RTK Query Loader taught me a lot about typescript, package maintenance and writing good documentation. I've also just really enjoyed writing a cohesive API that solves a concrete issue that _I cared about_.

**Do I still use the package?**

- If I'm writing a single page application or doing data loading through the client, then _yes, absolutely_.
- If I'm using react server components or using some other suspense enabled framework... _probably not_.
