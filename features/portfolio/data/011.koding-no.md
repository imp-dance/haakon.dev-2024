# Starting an open source initiative for new developers

[Koding.no](https://koding.no) is a resource for Norwegian developers, written and maintained by the open source community.

The initiative, [as featured on Kode24](https://www.kode24.no/artikkel/ber-om-din-hjelp-til-a-laere-andre-koding-problematisk-i-dag/79999029), was started in August of 2023. It aims to lend a helping hand for developers who are eager to start a self-learning journey to become an actual developer.

The website is sectioned into two separate parts.

- A "study-section" which helps new learners first discover their area of interest, and then dive into it in an organized manner.
- A "resource section" which is referenced in the study-section, and contains more lengthy articles on various subjects

## Relying on the community

The website is entirely dependant on open source contributions, but I have also written a lot of the initial articles myself, and do
go back and write more when I get the time. I hope that this resource can grow and become something self-maintaining at some points.

> Looking back at the last year, I'm sad to see the inactivity in the repository. I have been very busy since launching Koding.no and have not been able to contribute much myself.

The website is strictly non-profit, which means that there are no special interests involved when chosing which resources to include and exclude, this is entirely based on public consensus.
