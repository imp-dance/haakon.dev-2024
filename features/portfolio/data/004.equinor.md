# An introduction to Agile and SCRUM

While working as a consultant for Idean, I
worked on two separate Equinor projects. I'll
keep the descriptions a bit vauge, and with no
screenshots - since these are both internal
projects.

On the first project, related to internal
technology development and documenting tool, I
was hired as a replacement for a previous
frontender from Idean. There I worked for three
months, helping clean up various bugs and also
developing a few new components - including an
animated expandable search-field. We used the
SCRUM methodology with a team of between 10-20
developers, mostly from India. The project was
setup using `React.JS`,
`TypeScript`,
`styled-components` and
`Formik` + `Yup`
for handling forms and validation.

On the second project, related to internal
documentation for the various plants Equinor
owns, I worked "pro-bono" in-between other
projects. I mostly developed new generic
components like a Table-component and an
Accordion-component. The stack on this project
was quite similar, with `React`
and `TypeScript` - but this
project notably used `LESS` for
styling and the code-structure was more
class/object-oriented.
