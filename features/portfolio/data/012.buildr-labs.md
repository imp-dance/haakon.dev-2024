# Building software & brewing ideas

After years of working together as a part of larger teams, we decided to branch off and start our own company.

Buildr Labs consists of

- **Jahn Thomas Fidje** (`backend`, `ai`)
- **HÃ¥kon Svennes Underbakke** (`frontend`)
- **Morten Hauge** (`backend`, `ai`)
- **Christian KrÃ¥kevik** (`backend`)

Collectively, we boast extensive experience across various industries. What sets us apart is our collective expertise in product management, product development, artificial intelligence, and design.

Through Buildr Labs, I have been involved in various projects, including:

- A POC for an AI driven IRL-gaming project ([Newbringer: TAG2](https://www.newbringer.com/))
- A SAAS EV charge monitoring platform
- An AI driven sun visualization project ([Aither](https://aither.no/))
