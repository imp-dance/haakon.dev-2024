# Writing and maintaining an NPM package for the first time

Although not my first time publishing a package to [npm](http://npmjs.com/), this _is_ the first time that I have written a package that gets active use (18+ ‚≠êÔ∏è), and has been maintained for over a year now - with lots of bug fixes, feature releases and documentation writing.

The [documentation page](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev) for RTK Query Loader has over 25 pages worth of content, including a quick guide, examples, reference types and individual pages explaining various features.

I have made sure to write [extensive tests](https://github.com/ryfylke-react-as/rtk-query-loader/blob/main/testing-app/src/tests.test.tsx) to ensure that the package works as expected.

Developing this open source package has taught me a lot about typescript generics, writing good documentation and designing a well thought out developer experience for consumers of the package.

## About the package

[rtk-query-loader](https://github.com/ryfylke-react-as/rtk-query-loader#readme) is a package that lets you create reusable and extendable _loaders_ for your React components.

### A brief overview

RTK Query Loader is a package that lets you write reusable and composable _loaders_ for your React components.

A _loader_ contains queries that should successfully fulfill before render a _consumer_ (typically a component). The loader also contains a loading state and error state to render when appropriate.

Some features include:

- Supply as many queries as you'd like.
- Supply queries that [don't affect loading state](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/features/defer-queries/).
- Send down payloads that contain any static data.
- [Transform](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/transforming) the data to your desired output-format.
- Set up [default](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Quick%20Guide/extend-loader) loading and error states.
- [Extend](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/extending) existing loaders.
- Re-use existing loaders
- Create [stateful loaders](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/stateful-loader)

And even if you don't use `RTK Query`...

- Supply queries that are [just promises](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Exports/use-create-query).
- [Use with other data loading libraries](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev/Features/other-libs)
