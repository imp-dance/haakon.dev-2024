# Starting my own company

After 9 months at Idean, because of life
circumstances, I decided to leave and start
my own company. I'm was going to move out of
the city, and needed to find a more long-term
remote option, beyond the covid pandemic.

Although I initially looked into full-time
remote positions, I did get a proposal to do
contract work for a Norwegian
telecommunications company (Telenor), which I
figured served as a perfect springboard to
start my own company and start working for
myself.

For the first few months, I did my own taxes and paperwork - but I ended up eventually using [opk](https://opkas.no) and have been happy with that decision ever since.

## Telenor project

Over the last few years I have worked mostly on the Telenor project - but I have also made connections in the business, and I have contributed to startups and open source.

## Open-source

Some open source packages that have been developed under the Ryfylke React name:

- [rtk-query-loader](https://rtk-query-loader.ryfylke.dev)
- [Ryfylke React Toast](https://toast.ryfylke.dev/)
- [Typesafe CustomEvents](https://typesafe-custom-events.ryfylke.dev/)
